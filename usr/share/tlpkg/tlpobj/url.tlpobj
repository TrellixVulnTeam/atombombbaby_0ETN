longdesc The command \url is a form of verbatim command that allows
longdesc linebreaks at certain characters or combinations of characters,
longdesc accepts reconfiguration, and can usually be used in the
longdesc argument to another command. (The \urldef command provides
longdesc robust commands that serve in cases when \url doesn't work in
longdesc an argument.) The command is intended for email addresses,
longdesc hypertext links, directories/paths, etc., which normally have
longdesc no spaces, so by default the package ignores spaces in its
longdesc argument. However, a package option "allows spaces", which is
longdesc useful for operating systems where spaces are a common part of
longdesc file names.
