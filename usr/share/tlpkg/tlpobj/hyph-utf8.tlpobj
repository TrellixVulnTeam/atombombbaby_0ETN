shortdesc Hyphenation patterns expressed in UTF-8
relocated 1
longdesc Modern native UTF-8 engines such as XeTeX and LuaTeX need
longdesc hyphenation patterns in UTF-8 format, whereas older systems
longdesc require hyphenation patterns in the 8-bit encoding of the font
longdesc in use (such encodings are codified in the LaTeX scheme with
longdesc names like OT1, T2A, TS1, OML, LY1, etc). The present package
longdesc offers a collection of conversions of existing patterns to
longdesc UTF-8 format, together with converters for use with 8-bit fonts
longdesc in older systems. Since hyphenation patterns for Knuthian-style
longdesc TeX systems are only read at iniTeX time, it is hoped that the
longdesc UTF-8 patterns, with their converters, will completely supplant
longdesc the older patterns.
